# Basepoint-Filtration
The purpose of this software is to perform basepoint filtrations on finite metric spaces. The current code performs a specific basepoint filtration, called the eccentricity filtration; but the code can easily be adapted to perform other basepoint filtrations. For a description of basepoint filtrations and eccentricity filtrations, see the paper here *link*.

To run the code,
